### Financial Wisdom BTC Strategy

This is based on the youtube channel Financial Wisdom
bitcoin strategy. This has been developed on my own and
with no involvement with that channel.

Strategy

We trade based on the MACD on two different time scales. Weekly
and daily. When weekly is bull (macd line cross signal),
we are in trading window. We then use the daily to trade
in and out. On the daily, we place SL on the close when
daily MACD ha turned bear, if future prices crossed below
this SL we exit, we re-enter when daily MACD is back in bull.

Outcome

- We start with $100,000
- Start 2016, 1, 1
- End 2021, 7, 31
- With buy and hold, we end with 6,651,855.0
- With this strategy, we end with 2,397,266.0

Summary

Clearly, buy and hold is the better strategy. If we count
the loss making trades, approx. 1.2 million, that is still 
short from the buy and hold strategy.
